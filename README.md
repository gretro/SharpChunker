# SharpChunker
SharpChunker is a smart and lightweight XML and JSON chunker.

It allows users to read large JSON and XML files (or any stream) in .NET without overloading memory. This is especially useful when developing an importer or a reader of some kind.

## How does it work?
Currently, it doesn't. SharpChunker is still under development. The wiki will be updated in time with document. A NuGet package will also be available for easy integration into your projects.
